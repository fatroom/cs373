# USER INSTRUCTIONS
#
# Write a function in the class robot called move()
#
# that takes self and a motion vector (this
# motion vector contains a steering* angle and a
# distance) as input and returns an instance of the class
# robot with the appropriate x, y, and orientation
# for the given motion.
#
# *steering is defined in the video
# which accompanies this problem.
#
# For now, please do NOT add noise to your move function.
#
# Please do not modify anything except where indicated
# below.
#
# There are test cases which you are free to use at the
# bottom. If you uncomment them for testing, make sure you
# re-comment them before you submit.


# --------
# 
# the "world" has 4 landmarks.
# the robot's initial coordinates are somewhere in the square
# represented by the landmarks.
